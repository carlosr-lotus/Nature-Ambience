# Nature Ambience

- Website link: https://flamboyant-bose-16f9b6.netlify.app

## About Project

- This project is a compilation of different natural places that makes you feel like you're actually there with day/night differences.

- This project was developed using HTML, CSS and Vanilla JavaScript.

- This project was inspired by Rainy Mood (https://rainymood.com/)

## How does it work?

- When the user accesses the website, it will display "Waterfall" with a background image, plus two icons (sun/moon) so the user can change day/night of the current ambience. Once he/she click in one of the icons, a background sound will play according to the icon clicked. 

Below the icons, we'll see two arrows (left, right) so the user can access other natural ambiences.

- Current ambiences available: Waterfall, Beach.

## Update 11/06/2020
